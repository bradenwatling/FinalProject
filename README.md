FinalProject
============
My final project for grade 12 computer science. It is a top down maze-game where your objective is to uncover the map
(it's covered in darkness so you can uncover it using a circle of "light" surrounding your character), or when you
defeat all of the enemies (3 or 4 per level). Each enemy has different "AI" logic using A* pathfinding. One type of
enemy travels to its target (your position) very quickly, but cannot select a new target until it has reached its target.
The map is randomly generated for a certain size, using a recursive algorithm that I developed myself.

Created May/June 2013.
